            <h3 class="mt-5" style="text-align: center">Unit Testing and the Arrange, Act and Assert (AAA) Pattern</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">The AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) pattern has become almost a
                standard across the industry. It suggests that you should divide your test method into three sections:
                arrange, act and assert. Each one of them only responsible for the part in which they are named
                after.A test is a procedure that exercises a behavior to determine if the behavior functions correctly.
                There are several different kinds of tests, like unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests, but
                all functional tests do the same basic thing: they try something and report PASS or FAIL.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='/images/aaa.jpg') }}"
                     class="d-block" style="height: 380px; width: 575px; margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;"/></p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-7">
                    <h3 class="mt-5">1.Arrange</h3>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Arrange inputs and targets. Arrange steps should set up the test case.
                        Does the test require any objects or special settings? Does it need to prep a database? Does it
                        need to log into a web app? Handle all of these operations at the start of the test.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">So the arrange section you only have code required to setup that
                        specific test. Here objects would be created, mocks setup (if you are using one) and potentially
                        expectations would be set. Then there is the Act, which should be the invocation of the method
                        being tested. And on Assert you would simply check whether the expectations were met.</p>
                    <h3 class="mt-5">2.Act</h3>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Act on the target behavior. Act steps should cover the main thing to be
                        tested. This could be calling a function or method, calling a REST API, or interacting with a
                        web page. Keep actions focused on the target behavior.</p>
                    <h3 class="mt-5">3.Assert</h3>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Assert expected outcomes. Act steps should elicit some sort of response.
                        Assert steps verify the goodness or badness of that response. Sometimes, assertions are as
                        simple as checking numeric or string values. Other times, they may require checking multiple
                        facets of a system. Assertions will ultimately determine if the test passes or fails.</p>
                    <h3 class="mt-5">4.Unit Testing</h3>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Unit tests are an essential part of software development that
                        independently testâ€‹ a part of the app. Unit testing works in three steps, also known as AAA
                        .</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">A unit test can check multiple behaviors of a system, but usually, they
                        fall under two categories: state-based and interaction-based. State-based unit testing verifies
                        that the system produces correct results; whereas, interaction-based unit testing makes sure
                        that the system calls the correct methods.</p>
