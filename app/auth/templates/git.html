                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">GitHub is a web-based interface that uses Git, the open source version
                        control software that lets multiple people make separate changes to web pages at the same
                        time</p>
                    <h3 class="mt-5">Git Commands and Terminologies </h3>
                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">
                    <ul style="font-size: 22px;">
                        <li style="font-weight: bold;">Repository</li>
                        <p>A repository encompasses the entire collection of files and folders associated with a
                            project, along with each file’s revision history. Because Git is a DVCS, repositories are
                            self-contained units and anyone who owns a copy of the repository can access the entire
                            codebase and its history. Using the command line or other ease-of-use interfaces, a git
                            repository also allows for: interaction with the history, cloning, creating branches,
                            committing, merging, comparing changes across versions of code, and more.</p>
                        <li style="font-weight: bold;">Clone/Fork</li>
                        <p>Clone -Git clone creates a local copy of a project that already exists remotely. The clone
                            includes all the project’s files, history, and branches.</p>
                        <p>Fork -Creating a “fork” is producing a personal copy of someone else’s project. Forks act as
                            a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy. You can submit Pull
                            Requests to help make other people’s projects better by offering your changes up to the
                            original project. Forking is at the core of social coding at GitHub.</p>
                        <li style="font-weight: bold;">Branch</li>
                        <p>Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. When you want to add a
                            new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or how small—you spawn a new branch to
                            encapsulate your changes. This makes it harder for unstable code to get merged into the main
                            code base, and it gives you the chance to clean up your future's history before merging it
                            into the main branch.</p>
                        <li style="font-weight: bold;">Commit</li>
                        <p>Git commit saves the snapshot to the project history and completes the change-tracking
                            process. In short, a commit functions like taking a photo. Anything that’s been staged with
                            git add will become a part of the snapshot with git commit. It will save any changes to the
                            local repository.
                        </p>
                        <li style="font-weight: bold;">Merge/Push/Pull</li>
                        <p>Merge -Git merge will combine multiple sequences of commits into one unified history. In the
                            most frequent use cases, git merge is used to combine two branches. </p>
                        <p>Push -The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository.
                            After a local repository has been modified a push is executed to share the modifications
                            with remote team members. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to
                            a remote repo.</p>
                        <p>Pull -The git pull command is actually a combination of two other commands, git fetch
                            followed by git merge. In the first stage of operation git pull will execute a git fetch
                            scoped to the local branch that HEAD is pointed at. Once the content is downloaded, git pull
                            will enter a merge workflow. A new merge commit will be-created and HEAD updated to point at
                            the new commit.</p>
                        <li style="font-weight: bold;">Checkout</li>
                        <p>A git checkout command will allow for the navigation between branches created by git branch.
                            Checking out a branch updates the files in the working directory to match the version stored
                            in that branch, and it tells Git to record all new commits on that branch.</p>
                        <li style="font-weight: bold;">Status</li>
                        <p>The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It
                            lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being
                            tracked by Git.</p>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
